# Save the World

Save the World is a bubble pop game. This is **the first ever game that I developed**.
At the start of the game, you have 1 life. Each green heart you click gives you a +1 Life and each skull you click or meteor you miss gives you a -1 Life. Your goal is to get the highest score before our world collapses.


In **normal mode**, you should click the meteors and avoid clicking the skulls. Once in a while, there will be a green heart coming (which has a ridiculous amount of speed) which you should click and get a +1 Life.
In **speed mode**, you only need to click meteors because there will be nothing else spawning. Try to get the highest score.
